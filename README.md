# Computer-Graphics
All projects utilized the OpenGL and Glut libraries. 

Table of contents:

PA1 - Basic 2D Drawing: 
Created a 2D image of my name with flashing animations.

PA2 - 3D Wire Capsule: 
Applied 3D vector algebra to create a parameterized 3D capsule using line primitives. User input would independetly alter the number of faces of each shape of the capsule.

PA3 - 3D Stopwatch:
Created a 3D stopwatch with both hands of the clock moving along the circle and applying transformations to simulate a shadow of the stopwatch. I also implemented a reset feature to reset the clock hands back to 12 o'clock.

PA4 - Smooth Object:
Generated faces and normals for a primitive object in order to enable flat shading and smooth shading. User input would alter the number of faces of the primitive while generating the normal and applying the flat/smooth shading.

PA5 - View Mesh:
Loaded and drew a arm model in wirefram, flat, and smooth shading.

PA6 - Textures:
Applied texture onto a 3D tube model with shading. User input would alter the number of faces of the model while applying the texture appropriately to the model.

PA7 - Lagrange and Bezier Curves:
Applied Lagrange and Bezier curves interpolation onto a 3D curve where user would be able to select the number segments of the cruve to visulize the interpolation process.

PA8 - Splines:
Implemented quadratic B-spline using the Cox-de Boor formulaiton with uniform knot vectors, Catmull-Rom, and Bessel-Overhauser splines onto a 3D curve to demonstration different methods of interpolations. User input would alter the number segments of the curve and shift them around within a 3D space to visualize the change of the curve.
